# Portfolio
This is my portfolio site, which is data driven generated from source.
The main reason for this is to avoid having to add/remove/edit/duplicate html data and instead have everything auotmatically generate from data when running a generation command.

# Dependencies
- [Python](https://www.python.org/) - for site generation
- [Jinja2](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) - templating

# Run
One can run the generation process by running gen.py
